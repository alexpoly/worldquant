Reaching out to alumni
  * Alumni database is in career development folder in Google Drive. Last
    updated Fall 2020
  * LinkedIn works better than email for reaching out to alumni
  * Use cold contact template on Google Drive.
  * Keep Excel spreadsheet to prevent double-contacting
  * Volunteer rewards include PBG-engraved wine glasses or Starbucks gift cards

Event signups
  * Use Google Forms for event signups. See samples in Google Drive.
    * No need to get demographic data (school, program, etc.), but good for
      internal record-keeping and analytics
    * Ask ppl for Penn email. Events are for Penn students only!
    * Ask Penn Med ppl to provide alternative email due to firewall issues
  * Provide syllabus during signup. See samples in Google Drive.
  * See Nektaria for making flyers, or use Canva with PBG account
  * Can reach out to department chairs to spread the word

Last year's investment research series/pitch competition 
  * Started planning in Jan and started program after Spring Break
  * Wound up improvising some weekly speakers 
    * Plan further ahead! Reserve speakers in last week of January, preferably
  * Getting judges was easy, but speakers was hard
    * Speakers may ask for sample slides -- see Google Drive
  * Common complaint among potential participants -- "I won't work on Wall St."
    * Try pricing a single asset instead of company? Similar to case comp
  * Many participants did not follow through from signup to pitch comp
  * Should we restrict access to non-consultants?
  * Need to get good sponsorship $ this year (tough year for biotech!)

Other events
  * No mini-MBA this Spring, since that would overlap with investment research
  * End September -- career services workshop with Joseph Barber --
    resumes/interviewing
  * Early October -- career development panel
  * ⭐️ Mid October -- skills seminar -- 2 hours, 8-10PM (timezone issues), ~200
    ppl. have prior winning teams teach about case comp. Cover licensing,
    marketing, getting to market (make pdfs?). 
  * Late October - early November -- lecture series -- 4 speakers talking about
    industry, startups, regulation, law (Mike Poisel at PCI?)
  * ⭐️ End Jan - End April -- investment research series/comp

For now, weekly meetings about 30-40 min, 5-6PM on Tuesdays. Will eventually
become biweekly and split into Gabrielle+Yuwan and Me+Steven+David
  * Next meeting -- outline slides
