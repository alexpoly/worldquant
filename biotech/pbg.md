Reaching out to alumni
  * Alumni database is in career development folder in Google Drive. Last
    updated Fall 2020
  * LinkedIn works better than email for reaching out to alumni
  * Use cold contact template on Google Drive.
  * Keep Excel spreadsheet to prevent double-contacting
  * Volunteer rewards include PBG-engraved wine glasses or Starbucks gift cards

Event signups
  * Use Google Forms for event signups. See samples in Google Drive.
    * No need to get demographic data (school, program, etc.), but good for
      internal record-keeping and analytics
    * Ask ppl for Penn email. Events are for Penn students only!
    * Ask Penn Med ppl to provide alternative email due to firewall issues
  * Provide syllabus during signup. See samples in Google Drive.
  * See Nektaria for making flyers, or use Canva with PBG account
  * Can reach out to department chairs to spread the word

Last year's investment research series/pitch competition 
  * Started planning in Jan and started program after Spring Break
  * Wound up improvising some weekly speakers 
    * Plan further ahead! Reserve speakers in last week of January, preferably
  * Getting judges was easy, but speakers was hard
    * Speakers may ask for sample slides -- see Google Drive
  * Common complaint among potential participants -- "I won't work on Wall St."
    * Try pricing a single asset instead of company? Similar to case comp
  * Many participants did not follow through from signup to pitch comp
  * Should we restrict access to non-consultants?
  * Need to get good sponsorship $ this year (tough year for biotech!)

Other events
  * No mini-MBA this Spring, since that would overlap with investment research
  * End September -- career services workshop with Joseph Barber --
    resumes/interviewing
  * Early October -- career development panel
  * ⭐️ Mid October -- skills seminar -- 2 hours, 8-10PM (timezone issues), ~200
    ppl. have prior winning teams teach about case comp. Cover licensing,
    marketing, getting to market (make pdfs?). 
  * Late October - early November -- lecture series -- 4 speakers talking about
    industry, startups, regulation, law (Mike Poisel at PCI?)
  * ⭐️ End Jan - End April -- investment research series/comp

For now, weekly meetings about 30-40 min, 5-6PM on Tuesdays. Will eventually
become biweekly and split into Gabrielle+Yuwan and Me+Steven+David
  * Next meeting -- outline slides

## Subgroup meeting

### Investment Research course

Me, David, Steven

Asset pricing model is good. Acquisition, time to market, market size

Assignments/homework should be smaller, but focused. Less homework-like.

Historical cases? Fictional ones? Case study perhaps, with current candidate.
Could be hard to find information

I do syllabus design, Steven does case sourcing

First 4 weeks (before Spring Break) is intro: FDA timeline, IP, e.g.

Post-spring-break is panel discussions. We have good roster ready-to-go

2/5 is first week. Want judges secured by 2/1. Want speakers for weeks 1-4 by
12/20. Want all speakers and panels by 2/1. Backload with panels (diverse,
younger speakers)

Reach out to speakers early + iterate material, or provide outline to them

Want syllabus by 10/18. 10/31 is final draft

Reach out to speakers in 1st week of October. Want consistent day/time for each
session -- consult with rest of E-Board. Likely T/W/H evenings. Want hybrid
setup, likely in Huntsman Hall

Start speaker/sponsor/judging Excel sheet + syllabus Word doc + case studies
this week

Want more focus on VC. Preferably not Steven Sammut (kinda boring)
  * Lots of connections via Penn Health X
  * PCI could be good for judges

Application open 1/18 to 1/31. Want weeks 1-4 assignments done by 1/18, rest by
3/2. Want case prompts by 2/26 (time to think over Spring Break)

### Skill building course

David takes care of slides 1-20. I do slides 31-40. Steven does 21-30

Slides 1-10: Intro, personal introductions, industry breakdown, stakeholders in
life sciences, regulations, biotech lifecycle (commercialization), risk/time
adjustments, product types (very briefly)

Provide sources, formatting. Try following style guide. 1-2 references per slide

Plug the library guide (esp. in slides 41-45)

Focus on skill-building course in next 2 weeks

One new slide deck version per week

Weekly meetings 6pm Thursday, except next week (7pm)

## Meeting with David and Steven

21 September 2023

### Skill building course (SBC)

Sponsor will do 30-60 min training session, reducing our time
  * Aim for 1 slide/minute

Case prompt is fairly generic so far. Something about possible AI 

Important notes to hit:
  * How to perform market analysis and map out competitors
  * Important question: what does software do for biotech?
  * Definitely insert timeline funnel for drug development, esp. for rare disease
  * Eroom's Law -- lower R&D productivity
    * Risks of drug development, study from 2013
    * ⭐️ Risk + time discounting. I can cover that
  * Company and asset lifecycles can be covered at same time. Use same timeline

Nature reviews are good source for graphs

⭐️ Things to do for my slides:
  * Make simplified spreadsheet for RXRX evaluation
  * Expand on RXRX info/background, given AI prompt
  * Expand out sources to 2+ slides -- give people detailed info

Pitch slides for IR sponsors are work-in-progress
  * Updated timeline, spruced up images
  * Sponsorship tiers
    * IR sponsors give $1-2k typically
    * Benefits for each tier listed in chart
